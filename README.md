# Reviwer
> This project is a prototype for another project that I'm working on. It's a simple web app that allows you to review movies and create communities around them. It's built with React, Redux, and Firebase, makink queries to the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). If you want to try it out, you can do so by following the instructions below.
